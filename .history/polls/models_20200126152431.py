'''
Here, each model is represented by a class that subclasses django.db.models.Model. Each model has a number of class variables, each of which represents a database field in the model.
Each field is represented by an instance of a Field class â€“ e.g., CharField for character fields and DateTimeField for datetimes. This tells Django what type of data each field holds.

That small bit of model code gives Django a lot of information. With it, Django is able to:
Create a database schema (CREATE TABLE statements) for this app.
Create a Python database-access API for accessing Question and Choice objects.

Add polls to installed apps
